/*DRILL 7:
Creating your own tables: Build a select statement that queries for the following information:

Create a database with two tables. Assign a foreign key constraint on one table that shares related data with the primary key on the second table. Finally, create a statement that queries data from both tables.

If you need advice...How about a table with a first and last name column and a second table that has a phone number and address column?

When submitting DRILL 7 be sure to include the table creation code along with your INSERT statements and query.
